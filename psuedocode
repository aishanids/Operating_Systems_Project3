// 1. Object comes into existence, waiting for nothing
// 2. Thread registers but has not arrived yet. "I am going to wait on youe eventually."
// 3. Count of number of threads to wait for increments
// 4. Count of number of threads waiting is still 0
// 5. Repeat steps 2,3,4 for each thread
// 6. A thread arrives  "I am waiting on you now"
// 7. Number of threads waiting increments
// 8. Number of threads to wait for stays the same
// 9. Is number of threads waiting >= number of threads to wait for?
// 10. Yes: release all threads.  Number of threads waiting = 0
// 11. No: newly arrived thread blocks  
// 12. Repeat 6 through 11

// Questions:  What if a thread dies and does not unregister (Pathological case)
